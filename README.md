# Battleship
A two player network battleship game made with pyFLTK 1.3.5.


### Features
  - Resizable windows (based on my testing, this looks better in Windows)
  - Disconnection/Reconnection for playing multiple games
  - Mediocre graphics, but no extra images â€“ it's all generated by the program
  - (Hopefully) most things you'd expect from a battleship game
